# Semantic Search Using BERT 

Semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the content of the search query. In contrast to traditional search engines, which only find documents based on lexical matches, semantic search can also find synonyms. In fact, this type of search makes browsing more complete by understanding almost exactly what the user is trying to ask, instead of simply matching keywords to pages. The idea behind semantic search is to embed all entries in your corpus, which can be sentences, paragraphs, or documents, into a vector space. Semantic search algorithms used contextual embedding to perform look-ups, providing for closer cotextual matches than lexical matches. In this notebook, we search a question within a book and find the closest answers to the question.
